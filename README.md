OmniHub was made by myself and feautures some of the best free scripts for the games : " CBRO, GPO and Da hood" It also feautures Universal scripts like infinite yield Unnamed - ESP , Blissful's aimbot script and  exunys aimbot script

The scripts used are here :

CBRO : loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Danixik/LoaderV3/main/Main.lua", true))()  ---> loader which features 10 different script (stormy, bloxsense, bloxtap, hexagon, alora, pepsi, sprite, nixus, millionblox and arsus

GPO : loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CFA-HUB/CFA-HUB/main/cfahubfree.lua"))()

GPO : loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArponAG/Scripts/main/gpo.lua', true))()

GPO : loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghost-home/public/main/GhostPiece.lua',true))() at the time of uploading this script is patched

Da hood : loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NighterEpic/FadedLock/main/YesEpic"))()

Da hood : loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpaceYes/Lua/Main/DaHood.Lua'))()

Universal : loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source'))()

Universal ESP : loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ic3w0lf22/Unnamed-ESP/master/UnnamedESP.lua',true))()

I may be adding more games but this scripthub was made for games i like and actually for personal use but im sharing it on GitHub for you guys to use if you want.
